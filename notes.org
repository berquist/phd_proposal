The current plan is to write my graduate research proposal on
determination of molecular absolute configuration using machine
learning, specifically determining the relationship between
experimental optical/specific rotation and molecular structure.

* Features for machine learning

Most calculations can use some fancy DFT functional with a triple-zeta basis set, unless otherwise noted.

 - Representation: chemical formula
 - Representation: chemical name
 - Representation: SMILES string
 - Representation: InChI string
 - Raw IR spectra (experimental)
 - Raw IR spectra (calculated)
 - Difference IR spectra between enantiomers (experimental)
 - Difference IR spectra between enantiomers (calculated)
 - Optical rotation (experimental)
 - Specific rotation (experimental)

* Questions

** Machine learning

** Python

** Unsorted

 - What is curly (sp) SMILES?
 - What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?
 - What is the difference between optical rotation and specific rotation?
 - Where to obtain experimental IR spectra?
   - OSDB (Open Spectral Database)
 - Where to obtain experimental optical rotation values?
 - Where to obtain experimental specific rotation values?
